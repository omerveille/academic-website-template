### Dr. Odyss√©e Merveille

<br/><br/>

I am an associate professor at [Creatis](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site7/en) laboratory and [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/).
<br/>

I specialize in analyzing and modeling vascular networks to help clinicians in understanding, diagnosing, and treating cardiovascular diseases. 
<br/>

My research focuses on deep learning and convex optimization methods, with a strong emphasis on open science. I am dedicated to creating robust and reproducible tools that benefit the broader community.
